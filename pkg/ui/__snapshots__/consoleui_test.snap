[41m [0m[97;41mERROR[0m[41m [0m  [1mClient request cannot be processed (SNYK-0003)[0m
         The server cannot process the request due to a client error, such as malformed 
         request syntax, size too large, invalid request message framing, or deceptive  
         request routing. Review the request and try again.                             
                                                                                        
           If you carry on like this you will ensure the wrath of OWASP, the God of     
           Code Injection.
