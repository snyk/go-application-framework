        Pin a package at a specific version. Pinning is a capability not supported
        by all ecosystems, which causes a transitive dependency to be pinned at
        a specific version with an override.

        For example, the `replace` go.mod directive can override package dependency
        constraints, forcing a specific version to be used in the application.

        Pinning could break an application.

        Note: In practice pin actions today are solely used in python pip's packages as pip does not calculate upgrade paths

        package_name: requests
        pin_version: 2.25.1
