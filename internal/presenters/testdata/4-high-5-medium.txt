[33m âœ— [Medium] [1mCleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information[22m[39m
   Path: app.js, line 63
   Info: http.createServer uses HTTP which is an insecure protocol and should not be used in code due to cleartext transmission of information. Data in cleartext in a communication channel can be sniffed by unauthorized actors. Consider using the https module instead.

   Path: routes/index.js, line 69
   Info: This endpoint handler performs a system command execution and does not use a rate-limiting mechanism. It may enable the attackers to perform Denial-of-service attacks. Consider using a rate-limiting middleware such as express-limit.

   Path: app.js, line 23
   Info: CSRF protection is disabled for your Express app. This allows the attackers to execute requests on a user's behalf.
