For example, if a breached authentication token is hardcoded in multiple places in the application, it may lead to components of the application remaining vulnerable if not all instances are changed.\nAnother negative effect of hard-coding constants is potential unpredictability in the application's performance if the development team fails to update every single instance of the hardcoded constant throughout the code. For these reasons, hard-coding security-relevant constants is considered bad coding practice and should be remedied if present and avoided in future.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n- Never hard code security-related constants; use symbolic names or configuration lookup files.\n- As hard coding is often done by coders working alone on a small scale, examine all legacy code components and test carefully when scaling.\n- Adopt a \"future-proof code\" mindset: While use of constants may save a little time now and make development simpler in the short term, it could cost time and money adapting to scale or other unforeseen circumstances (such as new hardware) in the future.",

This information may then be intercepted by threat actors using sniffer tools or interception techniques such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks (often involving social engineering). Attackers can then use information gleaned to perform a variety of actions, depending on the information type. Possible actions include gaining unauthorized access, impersonating a user, moving laterally within the organization's network, or retrieving and potentially modifying files. This weakness is almost completely avoidable through intelligent architecture and design.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Build web applications around a security mindset and the awareness that sniffers may be present at any time.\n* Ensure that all sensitive data transmission uses reliable encryption.\n* Implement security measures so that sensitive results are never returned in plain text.\n* Implement multiple-factor authentication methods to validate remote instances.\n* Use SSL not only at logon but throughout communications.",

For example, if a breached authentication token is hardcoded in multiple places in the application, it may lead to components of the application remaining vulnerable if not all instances are changed.\nAnother negative effect of hard-coding constants is potential unpredictability in the application's performance if the development team fails to update every single instance of the hardcoded constant throughout the code. For these reasons, hard-coding security-relevant constants is considered bad coding practice and should be remedied if present and avoided in future.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n- Never hard code security-related constants; use symbolic names or configuration lookup files.\n- As hard coding is often done by coders working alone on a small scale, examine all legacy code components and test carefully when scaling.\n- Adopt a \"future-proof code\" mindset: While use of constants may save a little time now and make development simpler in the short term, it could cost time and money adapting to scale or other unforeseen circumstances (such as new hardware) in the future.",
