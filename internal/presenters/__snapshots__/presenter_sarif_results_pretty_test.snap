[33m âœ— [MEDIUM] [1mCleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information[22m[39m
   Path: app.js, line 63
   Info: http.createServer uses HTTP which is an insecure protocol and should not be used in code due to cleartext transmission of information. Data in cleartext in a communication channel can be sniffed by unauthorized actors. Consider using the https module instead.

[33m âœ— [MEDIUM] [1mInformation Exposure[22m[39m
   Path: app.js, line 23
   Info: Disable X-Powered-By header for your Express app (consider using Helmet middleware), because it exposes information about the used framework to potential attackers.

[33m âœ— [MEDIUM] [1mAllocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling[22m[39m
   Path: routes/index.js, line 69
   Info: This endpoint handler performs a system command execution and does not use a rate-limiting mechanism. It may enable the attackers to perform Denial-of-service attacks. Consider using a rate-limiting middleware such as express-limit.

[33m âœ— [MEDIUM] [1mCross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)[22m[39m
   Path: app.js, line 23
   Info: CSRF protection is disabled for your Express app. This allows the attackers to execute requests on a user's behalf.

   Path: db.js, line 30
   Info: Do not hardcode passwords in code. Found hardcoded password used in password.

   Path: app.js, line 60
   Info: Avoid hardcoding values that are meant to be secret. Found a hardcoded string used in here.

[31m âœ— [HIGH] [1mNoSQL Injection[22m[39m
   Path: routes/index.js, line 31
   Info: Unsanitized input from the HTTP request body flows into find, where it is used in an NoSQL query. This may result in an NoSQL Injection vulnerability.
