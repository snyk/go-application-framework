            Files from which findings should be excluded and removed from

            This is different from FindingAttributes.suppressions; the exclude is an
            up-front declaration that findings in the excluded files are
            immaterial to the test result (pass/fail), and should not be reported at all.

            Excluded files might still be used to link other files/findings though. For
            example, a SAST (source-to-sink) or SCA analysis (transitive dependency
            chain) might transit an excluded file, enabling discovery in a
            non-excluded file.

        SuggestedPackageUpgrade provides some basic information on how to mitigate an
        SCA finding in a managed package ecosystem with an upgrade.

        The upgrade does not take into account other dependency paths to the affected
        package which may have conflicting constraints. The upgrade version may
        introduce other vulnerabilities. This is the main difference between a
        suggestion and a remediation.

        For a comprehensive mitigation with satisfiability and security guarantees,
        the remediation relation should be used.

        If conflicts are known to exist this may be reported, but the absense of this
        flag should not be taken as a guarantee conflicts will not be encountered. It
        only means the conflict status is unknown.
